To get started you must follow or have the following ready. Click on the links for instructions on how to perform some of these tasks.

- A Microsoft Partner account with your clients tenant added to this account.
- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP) repository.
- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP API GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API) repository.
- An active Azure Subscription.
- A GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on what you need and the minimum permissions to do this [in Microsoft's Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-azure-resource-manager?tabs=azure-cli#create-a-github-personal-access-token). You only need the "Create a GitHub Personal Access Token" section.

Recommended: A [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse license](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-sign-up?view=o365-worldwide#steps-to-sign-up-for-microsoft-365-lighthouse). This is needed to access various API endpoints used in CIPP but CIPP will function without it.

For the installation and maintenance, it's assumed you have some knowledge of GitHub. Using the latest version of CIPP, you do not need to execute the Secure Application Model Script beforehand. If you have your own Secure Application Model setup you'll be able to enter these keys after setup.
