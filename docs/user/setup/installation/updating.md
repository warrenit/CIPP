# Updating

Update your application to the latest release using the following instructions:

### Updates

* Go to your own CIPP fork on GitHub
* Select Sync fork
* Select Update branch
* If prompted with a question asking "Do you want to Discard (X) Commits" or "Update Branch", ensure you click on "Update Branch" AND DO NOT PRESS DISCARD

Repeat the same steps for CIPP-API



If you don't see the update immediately - give the function app half an hour or so to finish updating itself.
