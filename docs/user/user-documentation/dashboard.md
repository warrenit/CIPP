# CIPP Dashboard

The dashboard is the starting point for the application, showing you the current state of CIPP, if you are up to date, and the last 10 log entries. This dashboard also shows how many tenants you manage and how many standards will run.

The "Next run" times on the dashboard are calculated based on the current date.

Note that if either state that you are on an older version, you should review the changes and then [read about how to update](../updating/).
