# Backend Access

You can gain access to the Azure backend by browsing to your Azure Portal.

CIPP also includes a quicker way to jump to the correct locations via the Settings -> Backend.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hosted clients can use the backend management system at [management.cipp.app](https://management.cipp.app)
{% endhint %}
