description: Apply pre-defined standards to your Microsoft 365 CSP tenants.

# Standards Wizard

{% hint style="danger" %}
Configuration Changes A standard applies actual configuration to the selected tenant, not just monitoring.

Note that by default, Standards aren't applied to any tenants upon setup / configuration of CIPP. Applying any standard should only be undertaken with full understanding of the effects of the standard, detailed below.
{% endhint %}

The Standards page provides the ability for you to apply or reapply specific standards to your entire client base. Standards reapply to your tenants every **three hours** by default. If a setting covered by a standard changes the next time the standards apply the value specified in the standard takes precedence.

Plans exist to implement more standardised options and settings, along with an alerting system supporting Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) systems, webhooks or, e-mail.

Some of the standards are explained below:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that some standards may require one or more companion (Intune) polies to be set to be effective.

Deselecting an option on the standard simply means it will no longer try to apply that standard. However, it DOES NOT turn the setting off.

IE, if you disable the setting "Enable FIDO2 capabilities", the next time the standard runs, it will no longer try to turn that setting on, but if the option was already on it will not turn it off.
{% endhint %}

### Meet the Standards

Low Impact Changes which have no user-facing impact or minimal impact.

It's important to review the sign-in reports to identify impact for each customer. It cuts off any connection and blocks future connections using legacy authentication in addition to blocking applications or devices which don't support modern authentication. |
