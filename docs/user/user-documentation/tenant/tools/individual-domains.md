### Details

#### Options

You can use the options, detailed below, to perform specific checks on domains:

* SPF Pre-validation
* Custom DKIM selectors
* HTTPS certificate verification

**Sender Policy Framework pre-validation**

Use this function to simulate a change to your SPF record and test that the syntax is valid and it passes the checks detailed [in the domains analyser](../../../usingcipp/tenantadministration/domainsanalyser/#sender-policy-framework-pass-test) documentation.

**Custom DomainKeys Identified Mail selectors**

Use this function to check the validity of a list of DKIM selectors instead of the ones detected from your mail provider. Supply a comma separated list of selectors in this field.

**HTTPS certificate validation**

Use this to run the following tests on your domain and an optional list of subdomains:

* Expiration date
* DNS name mismatch
* Certificate chain validation
