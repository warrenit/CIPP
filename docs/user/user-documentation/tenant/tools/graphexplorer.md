# Graph Explorer

The Graph Explorer allows you to generate reports using the Graph API easily; instead of a JSON representation the Graph Explorer returns a table with exporting options.

You can run any of the 10 default reports, or enter your own URLs to generate a report. This allows you to customize the data to your liking.

### API Calls

The following APIs are called on this page:

{% swagger src="../../../.gitbook/assets/openapicipp.json" path="/ExecGraphRequest" method="get" %}
