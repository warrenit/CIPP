# Offboarding Wizard

### Overview

The Offboarding Wizard is an interactive guide that streamlines the process of offboarding a user from a tenant in Microsoft 365. It provides a step-by-step process where you can select from a variety of offboarding tasks. These tasks include revoking sessions, removing mobile devices, resetting passwords, and more. This wizard also allows for easy setting of a user's Out of Office message and forwarding their mail to another user.

### Steps

The Offboarding Wizard includes the following steps:

1. **Tenant Choice**: Select the tenant from which you want to offboard a user. Only one tenant can be selected at a time.
2. **Select User**: Choose the user to be offboarded from the tenant. The selection is made from a dropdown menu that displays all users from the selected tenant.
3. **Offboarding Settings**: Choose from a variety of offboarding options to apply to the user. These options are detailed in the "Available Tasks" section below.
4. **Review and Confirm**: Review your selections and confirm to apply the offboarding process.
